# depression-analysis
The goal of this project is to analyse dataset about people with depression, uncover trends, and provide actionable insights for individuals and businesses. Using SQL, Python, and Tableau, I processed the data to generate a series of visualisations.

Dataset Description

	•	Source: [Depression Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonytherrien/depression-dataset/data)
	•	Size: 413769 rows, 16 columns
	•	Key Fields:
	•	Age: The age of the individual in years.
  • Marital Status: The marital status of the individual.
  • Education Level: The highest level of education attained by the individual.
	•	Income: The annual income of the individual in USD.
	•	Alcohol Consumption: The level of alcohol consumption.
	•	Sleep Patterns: The quality of sleep.

Tools and Technologies

	•	SQL: Used for querying the dataset in BigQuery
	•	Python: For additional data cleaning, transformation and visualizations.
	•	Tableau: For creating visualizations and dashboards
	•	JupyterLab: To write and execute Python scripts
	•	GitHub: Repository for project code and documentation

Data Analysis Workflow

Step 1: Data Cleaning with Python

In this step, I used Python to perform initial data exploration, check data for missing values and delete irrelevant colums.

Step 2: Data Exploration with SQL

I used BigQuery to perform data exploration and answer key analytical questions to prepare data for visualisation. 

Step 3: Visualization with Tableau and Python

I created an interactive dashboard in Tableau, which includes:
	1.	Average Income by Marital Status and Education Level. 
	2.	Correlation between Physical Activity Level, Income, and Employment Status.
	3.	Alcohol Consumption Distribution by Age Group.
	4.	Dietary Habits by Age and Marital Status.

[Bad Habits in People with Depression](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/myroslava.zuieva/viz/Book2_17366202826950/BadHabitsinPeoplewithDepression?publish=yes)

Key Findings

	1.	The analysis revealed a significant correlation between lifestyle factors (e.g., physical activity, dietary habits, and sleep patterns) and mental health. 
	2.	A strong link was found between family history of depression and individual mental health. 
	3.	People who reported higher alcohol consumption and smoking habits were also more likely to have chronic medical conditions.

Challenges and Learnings

	•	SQL Complexity: Writing efficient SQL queries to handle large datasets in BigQuery required attention to query optimization.
	•	Dashboard Design: Creating a clean, insightful Tableau dashboard involved multiple iterations to improve readability and impact.

Conclusions and Recommendations

For Individuals

	•	Encourage consistent mental health check-ins and create awareness about the importance of mental well-being.
	•	Promote the use of mental health resources through accessible platforms.

For Businesses

	•	Invest in employee wellness programs to improve overall productivity and satisfaction.
	•	Use data-driven insights to tailor wellness initiatives based on employee behavior.
